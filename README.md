How to get started üöÄ
- Prerequisites: A modern web browser. Optionally, Node.js for development and build tasks.
- Quick start (in a browser):
  - Open the index.html file in your browser.
  - Start typing or paste data into the data field.
  - Tweak size, colors, and styles to match your design.
  - Download the generated QR code as PNG or SVG.
- If you want a packaged version:
  - Download the release artifact from the releases page and run it locally. The latest release can be obtained at the releases page. For direct access, see the link below; it points to the same resource.
  - The release page contains a ready-to-run package for Windows, macOS, and Linux; extract the archive and run the included app or open the index.html if you‚Äôre using a static build.
- Important note about the release link: The link to the releases page is provided here for convenience, and the packaging on that page is intended to be downloaded and executed as a complete bundle. Use the asset named QR-Code-Generator_*.*.*.*.*.zip (or the corresponding installer) for installation purposes.

Run with Docker

You can now build and run the QR Code Generator using **Docker** or **Docker Compose**, making local testing and deployment even easier.

Build and run manually with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t qr-code-generator .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name qr-code-generator qr-code-generator
```

After the container starts, open your browser and go to:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


Run using Docker Compose

The repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for convenience:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    container_name: qr-code-generator
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To start the service, simply run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
To stop it:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Dockerfile

The container uses a lightweight **Nginx Alpine** image to serve the static site efficiently:

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.27-alpine

RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80
```

This setup provides a **fast, production-grade static hosting environment** without needing Node.js on the host machine.

Release access and download guidance
- Direct link: https://github.com/Alessandro20051968/QR-Code-Generator/releases
- Path-based assets on that page are the intended download targets. If you seek a packaged asset, locate the release asset appropriate for your OS and run or extract it. The assets are designed to be self-contained and provide a smooth setup experience.

How it works under the hood üß©
- Structure and data flow:
  - The UI is built with HTML and SCSS for a clean, responsive layout.
  - JavaScript handles data input, code generation, and rendering.
  - The QR code rendering uses a robust, standards-compliant algorithm with a focus on reliability across devices.
  - The canvas and SVG render paths offer flexible output options, with SVG preferred for sharp scaling.
- Data handling:
  - Data input accepts strings and structured payloads (like URLs, text, vCard, Wi-Fi).
  - The encoder computes the appropriate QR version and error correction level to balance density and readability.
  - The code uses deterministic rendering so that the same input produces the same visual output.
- Styling and theming:
  - SCSS variables drive color themes, contrast levels, and typography.
  - Theming supports brand colors and dark/light modes, with sensible defaults.
- Asset pipeline:
  - Static assets are bundled for fast load times.
  - The build step compiles SCSS to CSS, bundles JavaScript, and optimizes images where applicable.

Data input and QR parameters üì¶
- Data payloads:
  - URL: Enter a web address; the QR code will encode the URL so scanners can open it directly.
  - Text: Any plain text data that you want to share.
  - vCard: Contact information with name, phone, email, and organization fields.
  - Wi-Fi: SSID and password for quick-network sharing scenarios.
  - Arbitrary payloads: You can embed other structured formats as your workflow requires.
- Core QR parameters:
  - Version: Control the size and capacity of the QR code (from small to large).
  - Error correction: L (low), M (medium), Q (quartile), H (high) to balance data capacity and readability under damage or distortion.
  - Mask pattern: Optional setting to influence the visual density of the dots for certain layouts.
  - Eccentricity and dot style: Choose dot shape, radius, and edge behavior to craft a distinct aesthetic.
- Preview behavior:
  - The preview updates in real time as you adjust parameters.
  - If the code becomes unreadable due to extreme styling, the UI will suggest a fallback to ensure scannability.

Customization options in depth üé®
- Color and contrast:
  - Foreground color: Pick any color for the dots and finder pattern.
  - Background: Transparent, solid color, gradient, or custom texture.
  - Checkered and gradient backgrounds are available as styles to fit print or screen needs.
- Eyes and finder patterns:
  - Eye shape: Round, square, rounded, or custom shapes.
  - Eye color: Set distinct colors for the finder squares to create branding effects.
- Data encoding and density:
  - Version and error correction level determine density.
  - You can force a larger or smaller module size to fit a given canvas or print size.
- Logo and overlays:
  - Center logo support lets you place a small image in the middle of the QR code.
  - Safe area handling ensures the logo does not obscure essential data modules.
- Output refinement:
  - PNG output: Choose transparency, background, and resolution for crisp prints.
  - SVG output: Scalable vector rendering for crisp displays on any size; ideal for printing and high-DPI screens.
  - Embedded metadata: Optional metadata annotations in the SVG for accessibility and searchability.
